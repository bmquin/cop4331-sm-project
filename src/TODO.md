## To-Do ASAP

I know some of this stuff may be advanced for this project, but I wanted to write all my ideas down just in case we have time to implement it - Adam

- [ ] Same thing with the password. The user needs to know what kind of password that should be inputted, and real time feedback would be helpful -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] Finish the about us page -> @bmquin
- [ ] Make the page about what COPY is -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] Submit your bio and pictures to the repo for @bmquin to finish the about us page -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Finish up the router -> @DeliciousBred

- [ ] On the contact page: Could we kind of do a split screen thing where the inputs for each contact are on the left, and the results are on the right? That way, we won't cover up the center of the background -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] On the contact page: Ensure the partial matching works. For example, if I input "Joh" into the seach bar, should "Banjoh" show up? Or should it just be any contact with a prefix of "Joh" -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Make sure we all agree on the backgrounds for each page -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] SCHEDULE A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR ALL OF US TO PRACTICE THE PRESENTATION ->  @EVERYONE
- [ ] Finish the README file -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] Add in all AI Disclosures -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Comment all code files that you wrote -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Keep building the powerpoint -> @ABetinsky (Primairly), but applied to @Everyone
- [ ] Make Gnatt Chart -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] Test Accessibility and make Lighthouse Report -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] TEST THE SITE ON DIFFERENT DEVICES AND ENSURE IT WORKS -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] Work on other powerpoint stuff -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Add in all relevant side items (pictures, drawings, powerpoint, etc) to the repo -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Add in the disclosure to the images we used that aren't ours -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] TEST EVERYTHING FOR BUGS -> @EVERYONE
