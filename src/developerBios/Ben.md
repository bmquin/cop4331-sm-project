I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. I have prior experience using C, C++, and Java, in classes, and HTML/CSS/JS, frameworks such as Node.js and Next.js and (a little bit of) Python in Hackathons and other small projects. Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, watching tv and movies, listening to music, and reading science fiction books (my favorite is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).
