Ben is currently a Junior studying Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. He has prior experience using C, C++, and Java, in classes, and HTML/CSS/JS, frameworks such as Node.js and Next.js and (a little bit of) Python in Hackathons and other small projects. Outside of school, he enjoys playing video games, watching tv and movies, listening to music, and reading science fiction books (his favorite is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).
