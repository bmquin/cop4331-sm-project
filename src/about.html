      <p2 class="info">
        COPY stands for "The <strong class="redTitle">C</strong>ontact
        <strong class="redTitle">O</strong>rganizer for
        <strong class="redTitle">P</strong>OOSD with
        <strong class="redTitle">Y</strong>adavally." COPY is the website built
        by <strong>Team 1</strong> for the
        <strong>Small Project</strong> assignment required by the Processes of
        Object Oriented Software Development (aka <strong>"POOSD"</strong> or
        <strong>COP 4331C</strong>) at the University of Central Florida (UCF)
        in Orlando, FL. Our section of the course (section 3) is being taught by
        Dr. Aashish Yadavally during the Spring 2026 semester. This website
        implements the LAMP tech stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and is
        hosted on a <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> server with a domain purchased
        from <strong>GoDaddy.com</strong>.<br /><br />
        COPY was designed to be an easy way to manage your own personal contact
        list. COPY supports the following features:
        <ul>
          <li>Adding new contacts</li>
          <li>Deleting existing contacts</li>
          <li>Editing existing contacts</li>
          <li>Searching through contacts (including partial matching)</li>
        </ul>

        All in all, COPY is "The ULTIMATE Contact Manager!" We greatly
        appreciate you taking the time to use our site and to learn more about
        it! You can find our GitHub repository containing our code

          <h3>
            Hello! At the time of writing, Andrew is a Junior majoring in
            Computer Science at The University of Central Florida. He has
            experience with several programming languages, including Python, C,
            C#, Javascript, Java, and PHP, with the strongest proficiency in
            Java. He also has a bit of hands-on experience in project planning
            and software structuring through various very small personal
            projects, including mods, plugins, and macros for existing software.
            For this Contact Manager app, he served as one of the API
            developers. His main responsibilities focused on designing,
            building, and documenting the CRUD-based endpoints that handle
            contact management. He chose this role because he is particularly
            interested in backend development and has previous experience
            working with web APIs. He greatly enjoyed working on this project
            with the rest of the team and hope you enjoy exploring our work!
