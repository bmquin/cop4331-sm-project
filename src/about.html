                COPY stands for "<strong>C</strong>ontact
                <strong>O</strong>rganizer for <strong>P</strong>OOSD with
                <strong>Y</strong>adavally." COPY is the website built by <strong>Team 1</strong> for the <strong>Small Project</strong> assignment required by Processes of Object Oriented Software Design (aka <strong>POOSD</strong> or <strong>COP 4331</strong>) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). This course is being taught by Dr. Yadavally during the Spring 2026 semester. This website implements the LAMP tech stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and is hosted through a domain purchased from <strong>(fill in later)</strong>.<br /><br />
                COPY was designed to be an easy way to manage your own personal contact list. COPY supports the following features:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding new contacts</li>
                    <li>Deleting existing contacts</li>

                    <li>
                        Searching through contacts (including partial
                        matching)

I have experience with several programming languages, including Python, C, C#, Javascript, Java, and PHP, with my strongest proficiency in Java. I also have a bit of hands-on experience in project planning and software structuring through various very small personal projects, including mods, plugins, and macros for existing software. For this Contact Manager app, I served as one of the API developers. My main responsibilities focused on designing, building, and documenting the CRUD-based endpoints that handle contact management. I chose this role because I am particularly interested in backend development and have previous experience working with web APIs. I greatly enjoyed working on this project with the rest of my team and hope you enjoy exploring our work!</h3>
