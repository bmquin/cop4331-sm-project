            <h1>What is COPY?</h1>
            <p>COPY stands for The <strong>C</strong>ontact <strong>O</strong>rganizer for <strong>P</strong>OOSD with <strong>Y</strong>adavally. 

                COPY is an implementation of a contact manager for POOSD (Processes with Object Oriented Software Development) to satisfy the "Small Project" for the course with Dr. Yadavally at The University of Central Florida (UCF).<br><br> 
                Designed in the early months of 2026, COPY was built by a <a href = "about.html"> team</a> of 6 undergraduate Computer Science students. COPY is an easy way to manage your own contact list. COPY supports:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding new contacts</li>
                    <li>Deleting existing contacts</li>
                    <li>Editing existing contacts</li>
                    <li>Searching through contacts (including with partial matching!)</li>
                </ul>
                Basically, it's a way to store the information of those you care about, without having to remember any of their information :)
