## AI Assistance Disclosure
This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:
- **Tool**: ChatGPT 5.2 (By OpenAI)
- **Dates**: January 25th, 2026
- **Scope**: We needed to allow our website, copycm.com, to support HTTPS, as right out of the box it only supported HTTP. Without HTTPS, it would fail to load on some browsers, including Google Chrome, due to browser specific security requirements.
- **Use**: I asked ChatGPT how I could easily add HTTPS functionality within our website, to which it suggested Certbot, a free command-line bot that add's HTTPS support to websites. ChatGPT gave me 4 simple sudp commands on how to use and test Certbot. The given commands were used in the command-line and worked without issue in a matter of seconds. I now understand how to use Certbot in the future should this situation arise again.

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified to meet
assignment requirements. Final implementation reflects my understanding
of the concepts.
