# COPY Contact Manager

## Description

**COPY** stands for the **C**ontact **O**rganizer for **P**OOSD with **Y**adavally.

COPY was created as part of the *Small Project* requirement for **COP 4331C – Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development (POOSD)** taught by **Dr. Yadavally** at **The University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando, FL**.

Designed and developed between **January 2026 – February 2026**, COPY was built by a team of **six undergraduate Computer Science students**.

## Why We Made COPY

The goal of COPY was to design and implement a full-stack web application that demonstrates:

- Proper object-oriented software development practices
- Real-world client/server architecture
- Database design and integration
- Secure session handling and authentication
- Front-end and back-end integration

We wanted to build something practical, simple, and useful. An intuitive contact management system that works seamlessly on **both desktop and mobile devices**.

COPY allows users to:

- Add new contacts
- Edit existing contacts
- Delete contacts
- Search contacts (including partial matching)

At its core, COPY helps users organize and store contact information in a structured and accessible way without needing to remember every detail manually.
